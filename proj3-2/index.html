      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, we decided to implement parts 1 and 4. When choosing which parts of the project to complete, we chose the ones that seemed the coolest to us (representing glass and mirror materials, as well as depth of focus were really interesting topics). 
        Part 1 was mostly smooth sailing following along the formulas in the specifications - our two fixes came from fixing floating point errors and needing to cast to the correct type to prevent loss of information, and also we found that we were reflecting too many times in the Glass BSDF, so we tuned the parameter to our call to coin_flip.
        For part 4, we split up the task into the pseudocode provided, but didn't take the time to properly study the diagram before jumping in. Consequently, the largest headache came from calculating pFocus, as we multiplied by focalDistance (rather than the negation), effectively turning our rays the wrong way.
        As a result, nothing was being rendered for a very long time until we went back to the diagram to correlate each step to the picture.
        Overall, the project yielded some really cool renders that we're excited to share (and maybe use in our final project)!

      <h3>Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>
      <div class="images">

          <img src="imgs/spheres_m0.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Spheres max_depth=0</figcaption>
          <p>With a max ray depth of zero, there are no bounces in the image so none of the objects are visible. Only the direct lighting can be seen.</p>
        </figure>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Spheres max_depth=1</figcaption>
          <p>
            With one bounce, the light can bounce off the objects so we see the walls. However, the balls only bounce light from the light source in the reflection direction, so there's only one bright spot on the otherwise dark ball. Some of the
            rays in the right sphere refract into the sphere so there's some dark spots.
          </p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/spheres_m2.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Spheres max_depth=2</figcaption>
          <p>
            For two bounces, the light bounces off the walls and bounces off the ball into the camera so we can see the reflection of the room on the left sphere. The right ball is mostly refractive so we can't see much of the reflection from the
            surroundings. There's a bit of brightness at the bottom of the right sphere that is due to the refraction of the light from the light source as it bounces into the ball, then out of the ball towards the camera for two total intersections.
            The reflection of the glass ball is still black because the only light that comes off the ball and reflects is from the overhead light.
          </p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/spheres_m3.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Spheres max_depth=3</figcaption>
          <p>
            With 3 bounces, the light can bounce off the walls, then into the glass sphere, and then refract towards the camera upon exiting. The brightness at the bottom of the ball is now mostly on the ground since the light can enter the sphere,
            then exit and hit the ground, and then bounce towards the camera. The reflection of the glass ball in the mirror is no longer completely black but has a faint reflection of the room. This is because the light that bounces off the walls,
            reflects off the glass ball, and reflects off the mirror can come towards the camera, which provides a faint picture of the room.
          </p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/spheres_m4.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Spheres max_depth=4</figcaption>
          <p>
            With four bounces, the light that refrace through the glass ball on the ground can now bounce back towards the ball and then into the camera, thus making the bottom of the ball brighter as well. Additionally, the light that refracted
            through the ball and hit the floor can now bounce towards the right wall and go back to the camera, so the right wall is lit up. Finally, the reflection of the glass ball in the left ball is now blue because the light that hit the blue
            wall can bounce and refract through the glass ball, and then bounce off the mirror towards the camera. Wall + enter glass + exit glass + mirror gives 4 bounces.

          <p>The image looks almost exactly the same as the 4 bounce image.</p>

          <p>There are also no significant differences with the 5 bounce image.</p>

      <h3>Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
      <p>
          A pinhole camera model is essentially a lens with a very small, fixed aperture (thus the name pinhole). As light passes through the pinhole, an inverted image is formed on the opposite side.
        As for a thin-lens camera model, the lens radius is dynamic (thus growing the aperture). Images are formed using a thin-lens camera model by refracting light rays along the thin-lens and forming an image on the plane of focus. We did this in the project by randomly sampling a location along the lens radius, then
        calculating the resulting ray as it approaches the plane of focus. Additionally, a pinhole camera model always puts everything in focus regardless of the distance from the camera, whereas with the thin-lens, only objects within a certain range are in focus.
        This is explored in the focus stack below. Lastly, as a practical matter, a pinhole camera model is therefore not necessarily representative of how camera's in real life function, but the computations are much faster since you're not dealing with as many computations as you would with the thin-lens camera model.

      <h3>Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
            For this project, we split up the tasks - Jonathan did task 1, and Jedi did task 4. Given the amount of pseudocode provided in both tasks, neither needed the other for debugging support, but we 
        discussed the concepts if we weren't sure what certain lines were doing. We also performed the renders on the other person's work and read over each other's writeups to ensure that we understood the material in both sections.
