      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, we decided to implement parts 1 and 4. When choosing which parts of the project to complete, we chose the ones that seemed the coolest to us (representing glass and mirror materials, as well as depth of focus were really interesting topics). 
        Part 1 was mostly smooth sailing following along the formulas in the specifications - our two fixes came from fixing floating point errors and needing to cast to the correct type to prevent loss of information, and also we found that we were reflecting too many times in the Glass BSDF, so we tuned the parameter to our call to coin_flip.
        For part 4, we split up the task into the pseudocode provided, but didn't take the time to properly study the diagram before jumping in. Consequently, the largest headache came from calculating pFocus, as we multiplied by focalDistance (rather than the negation), effectively turning our rays the wrong way.
        As a result, nothing was being rendered for a very long time until we went back to the diagram to correlate each step to the picture.
        Overall, the project yielded some really cool renders that we're excited to share (and maybe use in our final project)!

      <h3>Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>
      <p>
        For part 1, we used reflection for mirror models, and refraction for glass models.
        The implementation of the mirror model was fairly straightforward, as we just needed to change the ray direction to "reflect" the light elsewhere.
        As for the glass model, we first implemented refraction to simulate how light would interact with the class by taking in a direction and outputting the direction resulting from such refraction. For this, we used Snell's equations to yield the transmitted ray.
        To determine the ratio of reflection and refraction energy, we used Schlick's approximation to decide whether we would internally reflect or refract the ray.

          <p>With a max ray depth of zero, there are no bounces in the image so none of the objects are visible. Only the direct lighting can be seen.</p>

          <p>
            With one bounce, the light can bounce off the objects so we see the walls. However, the balls only bounce light from the light source in the reflection direction, so there's only one bright spot on the otherwise dark ball. Some of the
            rays in the right sphere refract into the sphere so there's some dark spots.

          <p>
            For two bounces, the light bounces off the walls and bounces off the ball into the camera so we can see the reflection of the room on the left sphere. The right ball is mostly refractive so we can't see much of the reflection from the
            surroundings. There's a bit of brightness at the bottom of the right sphere that is due to the refraction of the light from the light source as it bounces into the ball, then out of the ball towards the camera for two total intersections.
            The reflection of the glass ball is still black because the only light that comes off the ball and reflects is from the overhead light.

          <p>
            With 3 bounces, the light can bounce off the walls, then into the glass sphere, and then refract towards the camera upon exiting. The brightness at the bottom of the ball is now mostly on the ground since the light can enter the sphere,
            then exit and hit the ground, and then bounce towards the camera. The reflection of the glass ball in the mirror is no longer completely black but has a faint reflection of the room. This is because the light that bounces off the walls,
            reflects off the glass ball, and reflects off the mirror can come towards the camera, which provides a faint picture of the room.

          <figcaption>Spheres max_depth=4</figcaption>
          <p>
            With four bounces, the light that refrace through the glass ball on the ground can now bounce back towards the ball and then into the camera, thus making the bottom of the ball brighter as well. Additionally, the light that refracted
            through the ball and hit the floor can now bounce towards the right wall and go back to the camera, so the right wall is lit up. Finally, the reflection of the glass ball in the left ball is now blue because the light that hit the blue
            wall can bounce and refract through the glass ball, and then bounce off the mirror towards the camera. Wall + enter glass + exit glass + mirror gives 4 bounces.

      <h3>Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
      <p>
          A pinhole camera model is essentially a lens with a very small, fixed aperture (thus the name pinhole). As light passes through the pinhole, an inverted image is formed on the opposite side via the radiance of a ray connecting one each pixel to the point we're imaging.
        As for a thin-lens camera model, the lens radius is dynamic (thus growing the aperture). Images are formed using a thin-lens camera model by refracting light rays along the thin-lens and forming an image on the plane of focus. We did this in the project by randomly sampling a location along the lens radius, then
        calculating the resulting ray as it approaches the plane of focus. Something to note is that points not along the plane of focus will have rays that don't converge like they do in a pinhole camera, leading to blurriness. Additionally, a pinhole camera model always puts everything in focus regardless of the distance from the camera, whereas with the thin-lens, only objects within a certain range are in focus.
        This is explored in the focus stack below. Lastly, as a practical matter, a pinhole camera model is therefore not necessarily representative of how camera's in real life function, but the computations are much faster since you're not dealing with as many computations as you would with the thin-lens camera model.

          <figcaption>Focus Stack Part 1: Focusing on the floor.</figcaption>
          <p>We begin the focus stack by focusing on the floor with the smallest focus depth, closest to the bottom of the image. As you can see, the walls in the bottom left and right corners appear sharp, contrasted with the blurry dragon and ceiling. This is due to the fact that all the points along the floor are in the plane of focus, whereas the dragon and back wall are behind it, leading to the blurriness we see here.</p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CBdragon_head.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Focus Stack Part 2: Focusing on the head.</figcaption>
          <p>We continue the focus stack by focusing on the head of the dragon. As you can see, head of the dragon is in focus, since all the points near the head are on the plane of focus. However, all the points in front of (e.g. the ground) and behind (e.g. the body and back wall) the plane of focus are blurry. </p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CBdragon_body.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Focus Stack Part 3: Focusing on the body.</figcaption>
          <p>We continue the focus stack by focusing on the body of the dragon. Same deal as before - all the points along the body are in the plane of focus, and all those that are not are blurry. </p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CBdragon_ceiling.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Focus Stack Part 1: Focusing on the back wall.</figcaption>
          <p>Lastly, the focus depth here is the largest by focusing on the back wall. All the edges of the back wall appear to be very clear, as opposed to everything else in the image. </p>

          <figcaption> CBDragon with a lens radius of 0.05. </figcaption>
          <p>We start with a very small aperture. Since this is similar to a pinhole camera, almost everything here is in focus.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/dragon10.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>CBDragon with a lens radius of 0.1. </figcaption>
          <p>As we increase the aperture and double the lens radius, we can see some more blurriness, particularly in areas of the image that are not in the plane of focus. If you look carefully at the tail of the dragon and the back wall, there's some bluriness introduced. This can be attributed to a wider range of angles for which rays can enter the lens (and more light generally as well), meaning that there's less light focused on a particular point in the image. </p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/dragon23.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>CBDragon with a lens radius of 0.23.</figcaption>
          <p>This is the aperture given to us in the specifications, where really only the body of the dragon is in focus since the lens is so large. </p>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/dragon46.png" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>CBDragon with a lens radius of 0.46.</figcaption>
          <p>Finally, a lens radius of 0.46 makes everything outside of the body of the dragon even blurrier, since increasing the aperture decreases the depth of field. </p>

      <h3>Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
            For this project, we split up the tasks - Jonathan did task 1, and Jedi did task 4. Given the amount of pseudocode provided in both tasks, neither needed the other for debugging support, but we 
        discussed the concepts if we weren't sure what certain lines were doing. We also performed the renders on the other person's work and read over each other's writeups to ensure that we understood the material in both sections.
