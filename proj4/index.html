      <h3>Part 3. Collisions with other objects</h3>
      <p>
        A lower spring constant will reduce the integrity of the cloth and the forces keeping it together so the cloth hangs more directly down and stretches lower. With a higher spring constant, the cloth becomes more stiff so when it rests on the
        sphere, it still extends outwards a lot as the springs are preventing it from bending and extending downwards.

      <h4>Varying density</h4>
      <p>
        A lower density cloth is a lighter cloth, all else being equal, so the dominant force in the simulation comes from the spring forces. This means when the cloth hits the ground, it'll bounce comparatively high and at a resting state, it'll be
        pretty smooth since the point masses are light enough that the springs can fully extend.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a high density cloth, the dominant force will come from gravity, so as the cloth starts falling, it immediately folds a lot and doesn't bounce. Additionally, at rest, gravity acts to keep the point masses stationary and crumpled so the
        cloth has many folds.
      </p>

      <h4>Varying spring constant</h4>
      <p>The spring constant generally has an inverse effect compared to density in these simulations. With a low spring constant, gravity/external forces are dominant so the cloth folds easily and remains crumpled at rest.</p>
      <p>With a high spring constant, the spring forces will be dominant and try to return the cloth to its normal flat state. Thus, it tends to bounce more upon hitting the ground, and at rest, it's flatter and has less folds.</p>
