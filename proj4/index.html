      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal in this project was to create a physically based simulator for cloth materials. First, we constructed the cloth using a mass-spring system where point masses were evenly dispersed along a given area and connected with different kinds
        of springs like structural, bending, and shear springs. After the basic structure was made, we added support for gravity and motion using Verlet integration, Hook's law, damping, and some position update constraints so the springs wouldn't be
        deformed too much in one step. These basic rules allowed the cloth to fall realistically, so then we added support for collisions so the cloth could land and rest on an object. We implemented collision tests for spheres and planes and
        constrained its motion so that if the next point mass position would go inside the object, we forced it to rest slightly above the surface. After that, we added self collision tests so that if two point masses got too close to each other,
        they'd be forced apart to a general minimum distance. This was optimized by using spatial hashing so that certain points only needed to test for collision if they were in the same spatial region. Finally, we added different shaders to give a
        nice appearance to the cloth. Blinn-Phong model shading allowed for semi-realistic light shading, and texture maps, bump mapping, and displacement mapping added more flavor to the appearance. Displacement mapping was especially unique since
        not only were the pixel colors set by the shader, but also to some extent, the vertex positions. Finally, the mirror reflection added a sort of ray-tracing flavor to the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ran into some challenges with ensuring the vectors and forces were pointing the right direction and that vectors were normalized. We also had some other small bugs with point mass position correction. Although it wasn't exactly a bug, we
        had some trouble figuring out the correct parameters for the shaders to reproduce the source results; however, it was a fun experience playing around with how each parameter affected the final appearance.

      <h2>Part 1. Masses and Springs</h2>
      <p>
        For the first part of the project, we represented our cloth by using a grid of point masses and springs. Depending on the orientation of the cloth (since we're working in 3-D space), we would place point masses uniformly distributed along the width and height of the cloth.
        After pinning the relevant point masses, we applied the three types of springs (structural, shearing, and bending) to support dropping the cloth later in the project.
        The largest problem we ran into was that the appropriate point masses weren't being pinned (none of them were being pinned at all). This was due to a faulty assumption that the cloth's pinned vector contained the exact locations of point masses to be pinned, rather than using the index.
        To create the springs, we followed the constraints in the spec, and used helper functions to convert a given row and column to the appropriate index in the 1-d point_masses vector.

      <h2>Part 2. Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
      <p>
        For the second part of the project, we simulated dropping the cloth by first calculating the forces on each point mass, then using those forces to calculate the new positions.
        Finally, we also utilized the springs to prevent too large of a difference from one timestep to another. 
        First, we multiplied the mass of the cloth by each external acceleration using the formula F = ma to find the sum of the external forces.
        Then, we utilized Hooke's law to calculate the spring correction forces by subtracting from each endpoint of the spring, taking it's norm (to find the distance), then subtracting by the rest length of the spring.
        After multiplying by the spring constant, we're given the force, which we can just multiply by the unit vector of the distance vector to find the appropriate direction to apply the force in.
        After we calculated the forces on each point mass, we used Verlet integration to compute the new position of each point mass by approximating the velocity to be the change in position from the last timestep to this timestep (which is why we store the last position of each point mass).
        We then modify the new position based on a given damping term (higher damping means that there is a higher loss of energy at each timestep, meaning that the simulation will settle quicker).
        Lastly, we constrain position updates such that between each timestep, the distance between two pointmasses connected by a spring would be at most 110% of the spring's rest length.
        We do this by seeing if our new positions using Verlet integration would result in overstretch, to which we would correct both pointmasses by bringing them towards one another by calculating the direction vector and correcting on both ends.
        If one end of the spring is pinned, then we apply the entire correction onto one pointmass.
        
        The largest errors came from not utilizing the direction vector when performing Verlet integration, so the appropriate amount of force was being calculated, but not in the right direction. This would cause our simulation to fly wildly all around the screen.
        
        Next, we experimented with some parameters in the simulation, notably, ks, density, and damping.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, we modified ks (the spring constant). Below are three photos with a ks value of 1, 1000, and 10,000 N/m. Per Hooke's law, a lower ks value would result in a smaller correction force being applied on our pointmass at each timestep. Consequently, the largest difference visually between ks values
        is the resting state of the cloth. With low ks values, the cloth hangs more (due to less spring correction forces). With higher ks values, the cloth is much tighter, as the springs mitigate the impacts of the external forces like gravity.
      </p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>
       Next, we played with the density value. As expected, a cloth with a higher density (think a heavier fabric) sags more than a cloth with lower density. This makes sense
        since the mass of the cloth is calculated using it's density, and a higher density would yield a higher mass. Since force increases as mass increases as well, the position of point masses would also change more quickly per timestep.
      </p>
      <div class="images">
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/proj4_2_density1.PNG" class="img" alt="" />
          <figcaption>density = 1 g/cm^2.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>density = 5000 g/cm^2.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>
       Lastly, we messed with the damping value. As opposed to the other two parameters, rather than modifying the rest state, changing the damping value modifies how long it takes the cloth to settle.
        This is explained because a higher damping value means that more energy is lost per timestep. The damping value is used when calculating the new point mass position using Verlet integration.
        These screenshots were taken after the cloth has dropped completely, and has "bounced" back up. As you can see, the screenshot with no damping shows parts of the cloth overshoot its original position when coming back up, whereas the screenshot with a damping value of 1% settles almost immediately.

      <h3>Part 3. Collisions with other objects</h3>
      <p>
        A lower spring constant will reduce the integrity of the cloth and the forces keeping it together so the cloth hangs more directly down and stretches lower. With a higher spring constant, the cloth becomes more stiff so when it rests on the
        sphere, it still extends outwards a lot as the springs are preventing it from bending and extending downwards.

      <h4>Varying density</h4>
      <p>
        A lower density cloth is a lighter cloth, all else being equal, so the dominant force in the simulation comes from the spring forces. This means when the cloth hits the ground, it'll bounce comparatively high and at a resting state, it'll be
        pretty smooth since the point masses are light enough that the springs can fully extend.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a high density cloth, the dominant force will come from gravity, so as the cloth starts falling, it immediately folds a lot and doesn't bounce. Additionally, at rest, gravity acts to keep the point masses stationary and crumpled so the
        cloth has many folds.

      </div>
      <h4>Varying spring constant</h4>
      <p>The spring constant generally has an inverse effect compared to density in these simulations. With a low spring constant, gravity/external forces are dominant so the cloth folds easily and remains crumpled at rest.</p>
      <p>With a high spring constant, the spring forces will be dominant and try to return the cloth to its normal flat state. Thus, it tends to bounce more upon hitting the ground, and at rest, it's flatter and has less folds.</p>

      <h3>Part 5. Shading</h3>
      <p>
        A shader program is a program that determines the color for a particular pixel on screen. There's a lot of different types of shaders that can be used to choose the color, for example, you can incorporate vertex normal information to do
        normal shading, or incorporate lighting information like position of lights, angle of light and angle of viewing, etc. A vertex shader tracks information about vertices like their position and normal vectors, texture map coordinates, etc. The
        position of vertices can be changed for displacement mapping. The program then interpolates these values along a face. Fragment shaders then use the values from the vertex shader to determine the output color of a fragment.
      </p>
      <h4>Blinn-Phong Shading</h4>
      <p>
        The Blinn-Phong shading model models lighting on objects as consisting of three main types, ambient, diffuse, and specular. Ambient lighting is general lighting as if a small amount of light was coming from all directions and lights
        everything at every angle to a certain degree. Diffuse lighting is lighting that is view-independent. It models light that comes in from a particular direction and assumes that it gets scattered uniformly in all directions. Thus, the
        brightness on a particular part of an object only depends on its distance and angle to the light source. Specular lighting is view-dependent, where the brightness is maximized when the angle of view from the normal matches the angle of light
        coming in from the normal. This means the direction of view will be aligned with the direction of reflection. Also, by controlling the exponent power, we can control how small or large the specular area is.
